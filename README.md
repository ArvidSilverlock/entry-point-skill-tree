# Entry Point: Freelancer's Cut Skill Tree

Simple pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript skill tree for the roblox game [Entry Point: Freelancer's Cut](https://www.roblox.com/games/740581899).

The share 'system' uses a hexadecimal bitmap of what nodes are owned.

It does not actually enforce any of the games rules, but will show warnings.

Many poor design choices were made ❤️.
